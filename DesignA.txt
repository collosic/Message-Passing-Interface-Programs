	Initialize MPI environment
	MPI_init with command line arguments
	MPI_Comm_size configure the number of MPI processes in the communicator
	MPI_Comm_rank 

	Perform Masters Tasks:
		Initialize the Array()

	// the offsets should already be divided up into its sections
	// all each section has to do is loop through its size 
	// and attempt to find the matching string
	MPI_Scatter(send in all parameters needed)

	loop through section of array:
		if the string matches the string we are looking for:
			set a flag to indicate it was found and return the needed information
			break

	MPI_Gather(Gather up all the information for each thread)

	if Master then:
		print the results
		write to file
	
	// Terminate MPI
	MPI_Finalize()


Program ends

func init Array():
	open file
	extract first 3 lines into NT, NS and searchString
